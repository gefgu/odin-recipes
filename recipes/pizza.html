        <h1>Bakery-Style Pizza</h1>
        <img alt="Image of pizza" width="500" src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F9299652.jpg&q=85">
        <h2>Description</h3>
            <p>Now found exclusively at one well-known pizza garden in Gravesend, Brooklyn, this style of pizza was once found in neighborhood bakeries. This pizza is deceivingly light, crisp, and slightly spicy. Enjoy with a can of soda. </p>
